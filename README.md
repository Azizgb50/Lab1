# ARTI 308: Machine Learning - Lab 1
## Student Name: Abdulaziz Ghassan

### Project Overview
This repository contains my work for **Lab 1: Getting Started with Git and GitHub**. As a student in the Computer Engineering Department at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, I am developing the version control skills necessary for modern **Machine Learning** workflows.

In Machine Learning, tracking experiments, model versions, and dataset changes is critical. This project demonstrates my ability to manage these changes using Git.

###  Core Concepts Applied
Through this lab, I have implemented the following Git and GitHub fundamentals:
* **Repository Management:** Creating a central project folder to store all files and their complete change history.
* **Commits:** Saving snapshots of my changes with meaningful descriptions to capture the project's history.
* **Branching:** Utilizing the `main` branch as the definitive version while understanding how to use additional branches for safe experimentation.
* **GitHub Integration:** Syncing local work with a cloud-based remote repository to enable collaboration and back up code.

###  Tools & Environment
* **GitHub Desktop:** Used to interact with Git visually for common operations.
* **Visual Studio Code:** My primary editor for writing code and formatting documentation.
* **Markdown:** The language used to create this professional README file.
